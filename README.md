# Ruby Learning Script

Welcome to this comprehensive Ruby learning script! This repository contains a Ruby script that covers a wide array of concepts from basic to advanced topics. Whether you are new to programming or looking to deepen your knowledge, this script will help you explore Ruby's key features.

## Contents

### 1. Data Types
Ruby supports various data types, such as:
- **String**: Used to represent text.
- **Integer**: Whole numbers.
- **Float**: Decimal numbers.
- **Boolean**: True or False values.
- **Nil**: Represents the absence of a value.

### 2. Variables
- Variables store data values and can hold different types of data like strings, integers, etc. Ruby is dynamically typed, so variables can change types.

### 3. Constants
- Constants are variables whose values are meant to remain unchanged. They are written in uppercase letters.

### 4. Conditional Statements
- **If/elsif/else**: Used to perform different actions based on conditions.
- **Ternary Operator**: A shorthand for simple conditional expressions.
- **Case Statements**: A way to check multiple conditions with `when`.

### 5. Loops
- **While Loop**: Repeats as long as a condition is true.
- **Until Loop**: Repeats until a condition becomes true.
- **For Loop**: Used for iterating over a range or collection.
- **Each Loop**: Used for iterating over arrays and hashes.

### 6. Arrays
- Arrays are ordered collections of objects. Elements can be added, removed, or modified using various methods.

### 7. Hashes
- Hashes store data in key-value pairs. Hashes are unordered collections and are particularly useful for associating keys with values.

### 8. Functions (Methods)
- Functions allow you to encapsulate reusable code. Ruby allows methods to have default parameters and return values.

### 9. Classes and Objects
- Ruby is an object-oriented language. Classes define objects, and methods are used to interact with objects.

### 10. Modules
- Modules provide a way to share code between classes. They can be included in classes to provide functionality.

### 11. File Operations
- Ruby allows you to read and write to files using the `File` class. This section demonstrates how to work with files in Ruby.

### 12. Exception Handling
- Ruby uses `begin-rescue` blocks to handle exceptions and errors gracefully. The `ensure` block ensures that cleanup code is always run.

### 13. Regular Expressions
- Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. Ruby provides built-in support for regex.

### 14. Lambdas and Procs
- **Lambdas** are anonymous functions that can be stored in variables and called later.
- **Procs** are similar to lambdas but behave differently in some edge cases.

### 15. Metaprogramming
- Metaprogramming allows you to write code that writes other code. Ruby's `define_method` method is an example of metaprogramming.

## How to Use

1. Copy the Ruby script from `ruby_script.rb`.
2. Paste it into a Ruby environment (e.g., `irb` or a `.rb` file).
3. Run the script to explore the examples.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby installed (version >= 2.7).
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts.
